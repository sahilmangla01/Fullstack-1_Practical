    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end web Development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it
        refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site
        production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple
        page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different
        browsers, devices and screen sizes.
